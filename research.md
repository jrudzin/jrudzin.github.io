<h2> Hurricanes, Oceangraphy, & Air-Sea Interaction </h2>

<p>My research interests include air-sea interaction and the role of upper ocean processes on air-sea exchange, tropical cyclone air-sea interaction and its influence on the atmospheric boundary layer, the influence of salinity stratification on air-sea fluxes during tropical cyclones, the effect of surface ocean waves on air-sea interaction in TCs, and the influence of air-sea interaction on atmospheric boundary layer stability and convection. </p>
