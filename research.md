<h2> Hurricanes, Oceangraphy, & Air-Sea Interaction </h2>

<p>My research interests include air-sea interaction and the role of upper ocean processes on air-sea exchange, tropical cyclone air-sea interaction and its influence on the atmospheric boundary layer, the influence of salinity stratification on air-sea fluxes during tropical cyclones, the effect of surface ocean waves on air-sea interaction in TCs, and the influence of air-sea interaction on atmospheric boundary layer stability and convection. </p> 

<p> My research philosphy attempts to identify atmospheric and oceanic boundary layer interactions holistically, especially in tropical cyclones.   Throughout literature, research approaches towards this topic lack holistic treatment to a fully-coupled problem. Atmospheric literature indicates the importance of SST to atmospheric boundary layer instability within TC environments but neglects examination of ocean processes that mitigate SST and air-sea flux into the boundary layer. Ocean literature thoroughly examines ocean processes within the context of TC environment but few examine how these implications extend into the atmospheric boundary layer. While complex, I believe it is fortuitous to bridge the gap between meteorology and oceanography in an attempt to better understand tropical cyclone intensity change.</p>

<p text-align="right"> I have experience in utilizing both observations and numerical models for my research. I am most familiar with insitu atmospheric and ocean expendable instrumentation deployed from aircraft, such as dropsondes and ocean profilers like ALAMO and AXBTs/AXCTDs/AXCPs, moored oceanic buoy data, Argo floats, satellite data that include atmospheric moisture and winds, and ocean measurements such as sea surface temperature, salinity, and currents. I am familiar utilizing simple idealized mixed layer models up to fully coupled ocean-atmospheric models. </p>
