<h2> Hurricanes, Oceangraphy, & Air-Sea Interaction </h2>

<p>My research interests include air-sea interaction and the role of upper ocean processes on air-sea exchange, tropical cyclone air-sea interaction and its influence on the atmospheric boundary layer, the influence of salinity stratification on air-sea fluxes during tropical cyclones, the effect of surface ocean waves on air-sea interaction in TCs, and the influence of air-sea interaction on atmospheric boundary layer stability and convection. </p>

<p text-align="right"> I have experience in utilizing both observations and numerical models for my research. I am most familiar with insitu atmospheric and ocean expendable instrumentation deployed from aircraft, such as dropsondes and ocean profilers like ALAMO and AXBTs/AXCTDs/AXCPs, moored oceanic buoy data, Argo floats, satellite data that include atmospheric moisture and winds, and ocean measurements such as sea surface temperature, salinity, and currents. I am familiar utilizing similar idealized mixed layer models up to fully coupled ocean-atmospheric models. </p>
