<h2> Research Opportunities </h2>

<p align="center"> <b>Postdoctoral Researcher:</b> I have funding available through the Northern Gulf Institute for a postdoctoral researcher to start after June 2022 that is interested in working on coupled tropical ocean-atmospheric-wave processes and modeling, particularly in tropical cyclones. Areas of interest are in coupled air-ocean-wave processes or landfalling TC air-ocean-land interaction. Other areas of interest such as tropical air-sea-land interaction pertaining to coastal environments or the Maritime continent or tropical air-sea interaction in areas of high oceanic variability.Preferable candidates will have some general knowledge or experience with the Unified Forecast System's Coupled Hurricane Analysis and Forecase System (HAFS-A) or Coupled Ocean-Atmospherice-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) model or a similar coupled numerical modeling system to utilize in research. Funding is available for 12 months with opportunity of extension. Funds for conference travel and research computer are included. If interested, please send your CV to johna.rudzin@geosci.msstate.edu with the subject "Postdoc Interest"</p>

<p align="center"> <b>Graduate Students:</b> I am looking for MS or PhD students that are interested in tropical cyclone-ocean iteraction, air-sea interaction, upper ocean dynamics, coupled tropical meteorology. Students must have a bachelors degree in meteorology, atmospheric science, or physical oceanography (physics or computer science is also accetable), be willing to learn about interdiciplanary topics, be self-motivated, and know basic Linux-based commands. Ideal candidates will have some type of undergraduate research experience, have conducted basic coding in a scientific language (Fortran, Python, Matlab, Grads, NCL, IDL etc). Please send your CV or resume to johna.rudzin@geosci.msstate.edu with the subject "Graduate Student Interest". Funding is available through Graduate Teaching Assistantships and Graduate Research Assistantship (GRA when funding is available)</p>
