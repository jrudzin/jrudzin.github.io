<h2> A little bit about my life's adventures.... </h2>

 <img src=/img/photo_med.jpg align=”left” /> <div style="text-align: right;"> <p> I have a BS in Meteorology from the Florida State University and my PhD in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography from the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School for Marine and Atmospheric Science. During my Ph.D, I examined how the upper ocean characteristics of the Caribbean Sea and distinct features, such as the Amazon-Orinoco river plume and the presence of a barrier-layer, play a role in air-sea interaction during tropical cyclone passage.I was an NRC postdoctoral fellow at the Naval Research Lab, Monterey from 2018 to mid 2021 investigating the role of  air-sea interaction in tropical cyclone intensification using the Navy's coupled tropical cyclones model (COAMPS-TC) in addition to a suite of insitu and satellite measurements. Currently, I am an assistant professor at Mississippi State University in the Department of Geosciences with a joint appointment in the Northern Gulf Institute.</p> </div>

<p>Although I love my job I also have a life outside of work! I enjoy going fishing, boating, trail riding on 4X4's, hiking, cooking, and taking in all of nature during my evening walks. I love to travel and see all parts of the U.S. and the beauty that is right here in the 50 states! I have driven cross-country 3 times during my moves to different positions and really like seeing the nature and cultures across the U.S.</p>
