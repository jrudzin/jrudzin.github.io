title: About me

---

I have a BS in Meteorology from the Florida State University and my PhD in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography from the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School for Marine and Atmospheric Science . During my Ph.D, I examined how the upper ocean characteristics of the Caribbean Sea and distinct features, such as the Amazon-Orinoco river plume and the presence of a barrier-layer, play a role in air-sea interaction during tropical cyclone passage.  I was an NRC postdoctoral fellow at the Naval Research Lab, Monterey from 2018 to mid 2021 investigating the role of  air-sea interaction in tropical cyclone intensification using the Navy's coupled tropical cyclones model (COAMPS-TC) in addition to a suite of insitu and satellite measurements. Currently, I am an assistant professor at Mississippi State University in the Department of Geosciences with a joint appointment in the Northern Gulf Institute.

### Research Interests

My research interests include air-sea interaction and the role of upper ocean processes on air-sea exchange, tropical cyclone air-sea interaction and its influence on the atmospheric boundary layer, the influence of salinity stratification on air-sea fluxes during TCs, the effect of surface ocean waves on air-sea interaction in TCs, and the influence of air-sea interaction on atmospheric boundary layer stability and convection.
