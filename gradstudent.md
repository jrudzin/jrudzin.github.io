<h2> Research Opportunities </h2>

<p align="center"> <b>Graduate Student:</b> I am looking for a Masters student for a graduate research assistantship starting Fall 2022. The research will involve 1) the creation of a dataset that includes atmospheric and oceanic observations that were sampled during tropical cyclones and 2) data analysis on observation dataset. Student must have a bachelors degree in meteorology, atmospheric science, or physical oceanography, be willing to learn about interdiciplanary topics, be self-motivated, and know Linux-based commands. The ideal candidate will have some type of undergraduate research experience, have conducted basic coding in a scientific language (Fortran, Python, Matlab, Grads, NCL, IDL etc), and be interested in tropical meteorology, particularily tropical cyclones. Please send your CV or resume to johna.rudzin@geosci.msstate.edu with the subject "Fall 2022 Masters Student Interest"</p>

<p align="center"> <b>Postdoctoral Researcher:</b> I have funding available through the Northern Gulf Institute for a postdoctoral researcher that is interested in working on coupled tropical ocean-atmospheric-wave processes and modeling, particularly in tropical cyclones but also other areas of interest such as tropical air-sea-land interaction pertaining to coastal environments or the Maritime continent or tropical air-sea interaction in areas of high oceanic variability. The ideal candidate will have some general knowledge or experience with the Coupled Ocean-Atmospherice-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) model or a similar coupled numerical modeling system to utilize in research. Funding is available for one year with opportunity of extension. Funds for conference travel and research computer are included. If interested, please send your resume to johna.rudzin@geosci.msstate.edu with the subject "Postdoc Interest"</p>
