<h2> Research Opportunities </h2>

<p>Graduate Student: I am looking for a Masters student for a graduate research assistantship starting Fall 2022. The research will involve 1) the creation of a dataset that includes atmospheric and oceanic observations that were sampled during tropical cyclones and 2) data analysis on observation dataset. Student must have a bachelors degree in meteorology, atmospheric science, or physical oceanography, be willing to learn about interdiciplanary topics, be self-motivated, and know Linux-based commands. The ideal candidate will have some type of undergraduate research experience, have conducted basic coding in a scientific language (Fortran, Python, Matlab, Grads, NCL, IDL etc), and be interested in tropical meteorology, particularily tropical cyclones. Please send your CV or resume to johna.rudzin@geosci.msstate.edu with the subject "Fall 2022 Masters Student Interest"</p>

<p> Undergraduate Student: I am looking for a motivated and independent junior or senior undergrad Professional Meteorology student for the Spring 2022 semester (and possibly into the summer semester) to help me aggregate tropical cyclone atmospheric and oceanic datasets. This work will require some knowledge of the Linux computing environment. An ideal candidate will already have knowledge of a coding language or the basics of coding logic. The time committment will most likely be ~ 3-4 hours two to three times a week. This work could possibly lead into a graduate student position depending on the student's performance. If interested, please send your resume to johna.rudzin@geosci.msstate.edu with the subject "Spring 2022 Undergrad Research Interest"</p>
